# CanteenReporting

The purpose of this was to move from manual entery to an online option that did the calculation for you and added it to a google sheet for reference to later.

This is created from a google form and google forms is the backend for storage of the data.

1. copy action url from form on google pages and paste into action url on canteen reporting
2. copy over copy over name from entry.113524754  to name area for each entry that is need on the canteen reporting
3. in the past I stripped all the code out of the orginial form and rebuilt it
4. learn more about css grid and apply to form
5. make evrything mobile friendly first
6. correct formating
7. orginize the different grids in responsive layout
  - meaning organize opening cash, total cash for the day, closing cash and amount in deposit envelope
  - shrink title, article, floatdepositname and notes to fit the screen
